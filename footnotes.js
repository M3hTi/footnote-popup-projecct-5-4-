export const footNotes = ['For Shakespeare to have identified Rosencratz and Guildenstern on the stage, the attendants who enter with them would have to move away from the group and position themselves as servants. Thus, the two unknown characters becomes Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, though which one is which isn\'t clear until much later.', 'Claudius pretends that he and the queen wanted to see Rosencratz and Guildenstern as a courtesy, so as not to offend them, but this line makes clear that the only reason the two have been summoned is so that they can be "used" by the throne to spy on the prince. Claudius\' niceties are empty but very proper.', 'Claudius wonders what, ‘apart from his father’s death,’ is causing Hamlet to behave in this morose fashion. The audience knows it is because Hamlet discovered that his father did not die of natural causes, but was murdered by Claudius. Even so, Claudius’s remark comes across as callous: surely he should be more understanding of Hamlet’s deep grief over his father’s death.', 'In other words, what\'s troubling Hamlet. Upon close reading, we see that this "understanding" of himself is really his identity, and that the prince is having an identity crisis that\'s made him forget how he should behave, given his station. Another way to put this would be that Hamlet has forgotten his manners.', '"Neighbour\'d" here meaning close, or of the same age as Hamlet, and "haviour" meaning "behavior." Claudius may also be suggesting that Rosencratz and Guildenstern are similarly moody and that this will both help them understand Hamlet and (maybe) make it easier for him to trust them.', '“to gather/So much as from occasion you may glean.” The King’s request here bears a great deal of similarity to the exchange we just observed in Act II Scene I between Polonius and Reynaldo. Just as Polonius asked Reynaldo to bring back information about Laertes, so does the King asks Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to bring back information about Hamlet.', 'It\'s unclear whether Gertrude is merely being nice to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern or if Hamlet has really spoken highly of them in the past. Given Hamlet\'s taciturn nature, it\'s unlikely that he\'s been very forthcoming with his mother about any of his friends, but it\'s possible that he was more trusting before his father\'s death.', 'That is, generosity or courtesy, the mark of a true gentleman. In Shakespeare\'s time, the "landed gentry" were a class of English nobles who owned and administered large estates, often overseeing many servants and farmers. It\'s not directly stated, but Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are almost certainly heirs to such estates.', 'Gertrude hints that there will be a reward involved if Rosencrantz and Guildenstern do as they ask. Typically, this type of reward would take the form of money, but this last line suggests that it may come in the form of favor or prestige in the court, since Claudius is the king.', 'Rosencrantz\'s use of the word "dread" suggests that he\'s personally opposed to spying on Hamlet, but knows that, because the king and queen are asking, this isn\'t really a request so much as it is a "command." To refuse would mean severe consequences, but to obey means turning on their friend.', 'The expression "in the full bent" means to the fullest extent, or completely. The metaphor derives from archery, in which one "bends" a bow in order to make a clean shot. Guildenstern might also mean that they\'re bending over backwards in order to accommodate this request, which they find inappropriate.']
