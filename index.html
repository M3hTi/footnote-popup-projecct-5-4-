            <h2>Hamlet, Act II Scene ii</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>KING:</strong>
                Welcome, <dfn class="footnote">dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</dfn>.
                Moreover that we much did long to see you,
                <dfn class="footnote">The need we have to use you</dfn> did provoke
                Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
                Of Hamlet's transformationâ€”so call it,(5)
                Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
                Resembles that it was. What it should be,
                <dfn class="footnote">More than his father's death</dfn>, that thus hath put him
                So much from <dfn class="footnote">the understanding of himself</dfn>,
                I cannot dream of. I entreat you both(10)
                That, being of so young days brought up with him,
                And sith so <dfn class="footnote">neighbour'd to his youth and haviour</dfn>,
                That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
                Some little time; so by your companies
                To draw him on to pleasures, and <dfn class="footnote">to gather</dfn>(15)
                So much as from occasion you may glean,
                Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
                That open'd lies within our remedy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>QUEEN:</strong>
                Good gentlemen, <dfn class="footnote">he hath much talk'd of you</dfn>,
                And sure I am two men there are not living(20)
                To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
                To show us so much <dfn class="footnote">gentry</dfn> and good will
                As to expend your time with us awhile
                For the supply and profit of our hope,
                Your visitation shall receive such thanks(25)
                <dfn class="footnote">As fits a king's remembrance</dfn>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>ROSENCRANTZ:</strong>
                Both your Majesties
                Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
                <dfn class="footnote">Put your dread pleasures more into command</dfn>
                Than to entreaty.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>GUILDENSTERN:</strong>
                But we both obey,
                And here give up ourselves, <dfn class="footnote">in the full bent</dfn>,
                To lay our service freely at your feet,
                To be commanded.
            </p>
